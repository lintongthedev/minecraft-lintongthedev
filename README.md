Minecraft by Mojang (Prepackaged by lintongthedev)
This is a version of minecraft that i have prepackaged for the ubuntu linux os.
It places the cracked minecraft launcher along with my own version of java.
It also creates a desktop entry for quick access.
This piece of software is provided as-is.
And I am not responsible for dead PCs, dead hard drives, dead dogs, or cats, 
but i'm very interested in thermonuclear war, so if you point the finger
at me for messing up your device just because this version of minecraft, I will 
send you to the mars with a Nuclear Rocket. Act accordingly.
I know this paragraph is conspiracy-included, so 
dont ask about it. Welcome.
